print("Hello, world!")

#This line of code will print the string "Hello, world!" to the console.
#In python, the 'print' function is used to output text to the console. The text that you want to print is called a string
#and it is written by enclosing it in quotation marks. In this case, we are printing the string "Hello, World!"
# which is a common way to test that a program is working correctly
