Suggested roadmap for learning Python:

1. Start by getting familiar with the basic concepts of programming, such as variables, data types, loops, and control structures. You can learn these concepts through online tutorials or by working through a beginner's tutorial or textbook.

2. Next, learn how to use Python's built-in data types, such as lists, dictionaries, and sets. Practice using these data types to store and manipulate data.

3. Learn how to write and use functions in Python. Functions are a key way to structure and organize your code, and they allow you to reuse code and avoid repeating yourself.

4. Learn how to work with files in Python. This includes reading from and writing to files, as well as working with file paths and directories.

5. Learn how to use Python's object-oriented programming (OOP) features, such as classes and inheritance. OOP is a powerful programming paradigm that allows you to model real-world concepts in your code.

6. Learn how to use Python's built-in modules and libraries, such as math, random, and datetime. These libraries provide a wide range of functionality and can save you a lot of time and effort when developing your programs.

7. Learn how to use Python's third-party libraries and frameworks, such as Django and Flask. These libraries and frameworks provide powerful tools for building web applications and other types of software.

8. Practice, practice, practice! As you learn Python, it's important to actively apply your knowledge by writing code and working on projects. This will help you solidify your understanding and build your skills.
